  <p>Cooking in Breath of the Wild is extensive, but there's no in-game system to track recipes. You can find Breath of the Wild (BOTW) recipes throughout Hyrule on banners and learn them from various NPCs. While learning them this way is neat, sometimes you just need a guide to help turn Link into a master chef.</p>
